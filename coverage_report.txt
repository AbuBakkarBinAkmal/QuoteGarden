Key Areas (low branch coverage)
- None ≤50%

Notable Signals
- DB loader emitted a Mongoose connect warning during tests; consider mocking the DB URI/connection to keep unit tests hermetic.

Production Readiness
High line/statement coverage overall, but branch coverage is notably low in critical request paths (e.g., controllers/quote.js and services/quote.js). Recommend: raise branch coverage to ≥80% for controllers/services, add tests for error/edge paths, and stub DB connections in unit tests. OK for staging; hold production until branch gaps are addressed.
